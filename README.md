# MSOA Framework Base

### What is this?

This is a work in progress demonstration layer on how to build out micro-services utilizing
Go gRPC micro-services with a simple Node GraphQL Gateway that can consume/expose them. Each piece
is separated and put into individual containers to live within a Kubernetes cluster.

gRPC allows the flexibility to utilize a variety of today's top languages while maintaining
a consistent (and more efficient) messaging protocol across services.

This repo will also share more information around Conduit (A promising new tool for developing
a high performing mesh around Kubernetes services.) and how you can utilize it alongside
the standard Kubernetes toolset.
